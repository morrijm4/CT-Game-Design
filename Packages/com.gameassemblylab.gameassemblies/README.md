# Game Assemblies - Local Multiplayer Game Library

The library currently provides a multiplayer framework for building resource production chains, where players participate in interconnected systems of extraction, transformation, and exchange. At this stage, the focus is on modeling material flows and interdependencies between player actions, enabling the emergence of micro-economies through cooperation, competition, and logistical coordination. The next phase of development expands this foundation toward the simulation of automation rule systems, where players will not only operate within production networks but also shape the underlying logic that governs them. This shift moves the library from simulating economies to simulating automation ecologies—systems in which value is produced through programmable processes whose ownership, access, delegation, and control can be negotiated among players. Ultimately, the goal is to support experiments in how different rule structures generate different social, economic, and organizational outcomes, turning the library into a sandbox for exploring the political and collective dimensions of automated production.

## Overview

Game Assemblies is designed to streamline the creation of local multiplayer games with a focus on:
- **Resource Management**: Convert, produce, and consume resources through interactive stations
- **Goal-Oriented Gameplay**: Create time-based or resource-based objectives for players to complete
- **Local Multiplayer**: Support for multiple players using gamepads or keyboard input
- **Modular Design**: Mix and match systems to create unique game experiences

## Core Philosophy

The library is built around the concept of **resource conversion chains** — players gather base resources, process them through stations, and deliver final products to achieve goals. This creates engaging gameplay loops where coordination, planning, and efficiency are key to success.
